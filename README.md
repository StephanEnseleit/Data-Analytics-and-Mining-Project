## Dataset

This project uses the ["Communities and Crime" dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/communities+and+crime+unnormalized) which "combines socio-economic data from the '90 Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 Law Enforcement Management and Admin Stats survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR".

## Reproducing analysis

To reproduce our analyses run the corresponding jupyter notebooks in our `analyses` folder for `data_exploration`, `pca_communities` and `fuzzy_clustering`. To reproduce our linear regression analysis run the `crime_data_lin_reg.py` file in the `analyses` folder.
